# 📚 Library Management System

## 📌 Project Description  
The **Library Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage library operations efficiently. It enables users to **add, search, issue, and return books**, as well as maintain a record of borrowers. The system is developed to **streamline book management and enhance accessibility** for librarians and users.

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Add new books to the library  
✔️ Search for books by title, author, or ID  
✔️ Issue books to borrowers  
✔️ Return books and update availability  
✔️ Maintain borrower details    
✔️ Data persistence using file handling or database  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Data Storage:** File handling (TXT/CSV) or Database (MySQL, SQLite)  
- **OOP Concepts:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism  

## 📥 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone this repository:
